AN ADVANCED LOOK AT FUNCTIONS -- 
_____________________________________________
Function Scope -- 
_____________________________________________
GOALS : 
-understand scope 
-write higher order functions 
-pass functions as callbacks 

SCOPE - variable visibility 
- the location where a variable is defined dictates where we have access to that variable 

the portion of your code where other values have access to it. 

Function Scope

function helpMe(){
    let msg = 'Im on fire';
    msg; //'Im on fire';
}

msg// NOT DEFINED 

msg is scoped to the helpMe function



BLOCK SCOPE -- 
_____________________________________________

let radius = 8;

if(radius > 0){
    const PI = 3.14;
    let circ = 2 * PI * radius;
}

console.log(radius) // 8;
console.log(PI);  // NOT DEFINED 
console.log(circ);  //MOT DEFINED

PI and circ are scoped to the BLOCK 

let and const are block scoped, you only have access to them within the scope of which ever block you defined them in--
if they are defined within a variable they are only available within the scope of that singular function, if they sit within 
a for loop they are only availble to you within that loop and cant be accessed outside of the loop. 


LEXICAL SCOPE -- 
_____________________________________________

see examples in app6.js 


FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS -- 
_____________________________________________

Usually we write functions like so: 

function funcName(){
    //do something;
}

There is another way to right these called function expressions: 

const square = function (num){
    return num * num;
}
square(7); // 49;

Here we are storing a function in variable and then referring to that variable to execute the function.  Why does this work? 
Because functions are objects!!!!!!



HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS -- 
_____________________________________________
see app6.js for examples 


FUNCTIONS AS ARGUMENTS -- 
_____________________________________________

HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS - functions that operate on/with other functions. They can: 
-Accept other functions as arguments 
-return a function 

here we can pass in functions that have already been built out to as arguments. see app6.js for examples 


FUNCTIONS AS RETURN VALUES -- 
_____________________________________________

What you are doing here is making a function into a factory.  You pass in an argument for it to take in and have it reutrn a function 

function myFunc(num){
    return fucntion(x){
        return x * x;
    }
}

then we are going to set myFunc equal to a predetermined number 

const square = myFunc(2);  

what this will do is see that when you call square you are going to pass it an arugment of a number JS will take that number and see that the
return value should be that number times itself giving you the squre root of that number.

so when you run this: 
square(2);
it should give you: 
4 

the number 2 in the case of square is = x 
and the number 2 of myFunc is num 


CALBACK FUNCTIONS -- 
_____________________________________________

calback functions are :
functions that are passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function. 

So anytime we call a function as an argument in another function to be executed it is a CALBACK: 

function callTwice(func){
    func();
    func();
}
function laugh(){
    console.log('HAHA');
}

callTwice(laugh);
//HAHA
//HAHA
In this case laugh is the callback function. 

We can also pass in anonomyous functions to take in other functions 

see app6.js for examples of eventlisteners and settimeouts.  you dont always need to add functions with certain names to call on you 
can just pass something a function like a clickevent or a setimeout if you dont need anything specific and it only needs to happen one time. 


HOISTING -- 
_____________________________________________
RULE OF THUMB:::::: 

ALWAYS DECLARE AND INITIALIXE YOUR VARIABLES AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE/FILE!!!!!!!!
