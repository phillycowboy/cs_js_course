COMMUNICATING WITH EVENTS -- 

INTRO TO THE DOM -- 
__________________________________________________

EVENTS - responding to user inputs and actions!! 

Events allow us to run that code that creates a new element or to remove an element or to change a color 
when a specific interaction happens from a user 

There are tons of events out there : 

-click
-drags 
-drops
-hovers
-scrolls 
-form submission 
-key presses 
-focus/blur 
-mouse wheel 
-double click 
-copying 
-pasting 
-audio start 
-screen resize
-printing

We are going to follow a pattern so that we only have to use one method to get these events to work 


2 WAYS NOT TO ADD EVENTS!!!!!!! -- 
__________________________________________________

so the triggers for events are different but the way we incorporate these events into our code follows the same pattern 

we essentially have: 

the thing (what were listening for an event on) -- we're listening to see when an event occurs on a given thing(a click on a button, drag of an image)

the eventType -- what type of event that is going to occur 

then 

theCode -- then we tell JS here is the code that I want you to run 

so for example: 

the thing      the eventType         the code
*********      *************         ********* 
button           click                 change the color 
input           hits return           get search results 
image           mouseover               display the image caption    

we have a button that is waiting or lisitening for a click event and when it hears it, it will trigger the code to change the color 

1). DONT FUCKING DO THIS -- the first way to addEventListeners is to do it inline with the HTML

so on the element we can add an attriute called onclick=""
 <button onclick="alert("YOU CLICKED ME!")">Click Me!</button>

You can add multiple onEVENTLISTENERS in line with your markup, never do this, it clutters your markup and its hard to keep organized


2.) DONT FUCKING DO THIS-- THIS IS THE SECOND WAY OF HOW TO ADD AN EVENT LISTENER WITH YOUR JS SCRIPT 

you add an element and find it and save it to a variable: 

 <button id="clicker">CLICKER</button>
 const btn = document.querySelector('#clicker');

 then you use that variable and call an event on it and give it some code to run: 

btn.onclick = function(){
    alert("YOU CLICKED ME GO AWAY!!");
}



ADDEVENTLISTENER--

3.) THIS IS THE WAY -- addEventListener -- 

add the element, find the element, save the element to a variable - 

const btn = document.querySelector('button')

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('YOU CLICKED ME!')
})

THIS IS THE WAY *CUE MANDO MUSIC*

Specify the event type and a callback to run 

We are calling the method on the element and scpecifying what to do after the event is triggered-- 

we can have hundreds of events on one element
