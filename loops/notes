LOOPS INTRO!!!!! 
_________________________________________________________

How do we get code to run mulitple times unitl something is satisfied or completed? 

Looping 

How do we get a game to run its loop until game over?  Not just in console 10 times but for the code itself. 

GOALS : 

- write FOR loops 
- write WHILE loops 
- avoid INFINITE loops 
- and iterate over arrays and objects 

LOOPS- 
doing things repeatadley 
- Loops allow us to repeat code
    - print 'hello' ten times 
    -sum all numbers in an array 
- There are multiple types of loops 
    - for loop 
    -while loop 
    -for ... of loop 
    -for...in loop 


    FOR LOOP -- 
    _________________________________________________________

    for soemthing set a counter, tell the counter when to stop, tell counter how to count 
    run a block of code: 

    for(set counter: let i = 0; tell counter when to stop: i <=10; tell counter how to count: i++){
        run some block of code: console.log(i);
    }



INFINITE LOOP!---- 
_________________________________________________________

so an infinite loop is a loop where the second condition is never met so it will always keep running 

DO NOT RUN THIS CODE -- or do i dont care im not your dad. 

for(let i = 20; i >= 0; i++){
    console.log(i);
}

in this case i will ALWAYS be GREATER THAN 0 because it is equal to 20. 

the thing to remeber with loops is to make sure that you are going in the right direction 

make sure your second statement makes sense will i ever be less than or equal to this number, will it ever be greater, if you are counting by thrids
will it ever reach or even touch an even number. 

also avoid equality and non equality you may never reach that number !==, !=, ==, === 


FOR LOOPS AND ARRAYS -- 
_________________________________________________________

to loop over an array start at 0 and continue to the last index (length -1)
