LOOPS INTRO!!!!! 
_________________________________________________________

How do we get code to run mulitple times unitl something is satisfied or completed? 

Looping 

How do we get a game to run its loop until game over?  Not just in console 10 times but for the code itself. 

GOALS : 

- write FOR loops 
- write WHILE loops 
- avoid INFINITE loops 
- and iterate over arrays and objects 

LOOPS- 
doing things repeatadley 
- Loops allow us to repeat code
    - print 'hello' ten times 
    -sum all numbers in an array 
- There are multiple types of loops 
    - for loop 
    -while loop 
    -for ... of loop 
    -for...in loop 


    FOR LOOP -- 
    _________________________________________________________

    for soemthing set a counter, tell the counter when to stop, tell counter how to count 
    run a block of code: 

    for(set counter: let i = 0; tell counter when to stop: i <=10; tell counter how to count: i++){
        run some block of code: console.log(i);
    }



INFINITE LOOP!---- 
_________________________________________________________

so an infinite loop is a loop where the second condition is never met so it will always keep running 

DO NOT RUN THIS CODE -- or do i dont care im not your dad. 

for(let i = 20; i >= 0; i++){
    console.log(i);
}

in this case i will ALWAYS be GREATER THAN 0 because it is equal to 20. 

the thing to remeber with loops is to make sure that you are going in the right direction 

make sure your second statement makes sense will i ever be less than or equal to this number, will it ever be greater, if you are counting by thrids
will it ever reach or even touch an even number. 

also avoid equality and non equality you may never reach that number !==, !=, ==, === 


FOR LOOPS AND ARRAYS -- 
_________________________________________________________

to loop over an array start at 0 and continue to the last index (length -1)
as long as i is less than the length of the array 




NESTED LOOPS -- 
_________________________________________________________


for every iteration of the outer loop the inner loop will run how ever many times you told it too, 
then go back to the second of the iteration of the outer loop and so on. 

to grab data from a nested array you need a nested loop: 

the outer loop (first iteration), will grab the nested array in its entireity

then the innner loop will grad the data within each individual nested array within the main array



WHILE LOOPS -- 
_________________________________________________________

a while loop continues to run as long as its test condition is true. 


while(some condition is true){
    run this code in here. 
}



BREAK KEY WORD--
_________________________________________________________
a special keyword in JS we can use inside of loops to break out of that current loop 

for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i)
    if(i === 5){
        break;
    }
}

//1
//2
//3
//4
//5

so after a condition is met, break will stop the loop. 


FOR...OF LOOP -- 

_________________________________________________________

for...of loop is a nice and easy way of iterating over arrays (or other iterable objects)


for(variable of iterable){
    statement 
}

for this loop you do not have to set a counter and tell it when to stop counting.  by setting your variable OF the array within the conditional 
for...of will look at both and see that this is now i and the array has been declared it will then run the block of code until its false.

for(let char of 'hello'){
    console.log(char);
}

//h
//e
//l
//l
//o  



COMPARING FOR AND FOR OF -- 

_________________________________________________________

sometimes it is necessary to use just the FOR loop.  when you want to know the index of something and set it yourself. 

FOR OF you would have to find out what it is bc JS is just doing all that work for you. 



FOR OF WITH OBJECTS -- 
_________________________________________________________

you cannot iterate over an object the traditional way with FOR and FOR OF loops-- 

with objects you have to grab the key or the value using the Objec.keys(objectName) or Object.values(objectName)-- 

then do somehting with the variable you set in your for of loop or for loop.  


FOR...IN LOOPS ----
_________________________________________________________

so we are going to use IN instead of FOR with this condition

for(variable IN object){
    statement 
}
