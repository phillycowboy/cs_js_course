INTRO INTO AJAX -- 
_________________________________________________________________

REQUESTS: 
-XMLHTTP
-FETCH
-AXIOS

AJAX - 
A - ASYNCHRONOUS 
J - JAVASCRIPT 
A - AND 
X - XML 

ASYNCHRONOUSLY SENDING DATA OR REQUESTING DATA FROM A SERVER. WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THE SERVER BEHIND THE SCENES NOT IN BETWEEN PAGE LOADS 

BETWEEN WHAT THE USER SEES AND WHEN THE PAGE LOADS THAT IS OUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE SERVER 

THE RESPONSE YOU GET BACK IS JSON -- NOT SO MUCH XML ANYMORE, ITS A FORMAT FOR SENDING DATA 

JSON IS A WAY FOR US TO SEND DATA FROM SERVER TO SERVER OR SERVER TO BROWSER, AND THEN WE TAKE THAT JSON AND USE JAVASCRIPT TO DO SOMETHING WITH 
IT 


A REQUEST IS SENT AND WE GET JSON BACK 

JAVASCRIPT THEN PARSES THE JSON INTO INFORMATION THAT WE CAN READ

JAVASCRIPT THEN TAKES THAT INFO AND TURNS IT INTO ELEMENTS ON THE PAGE IT MANIPULATES THE DOM
