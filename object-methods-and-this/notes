OBJECT METHODS AND THE 'THIS' KEYWORD -- 
____________________________________________________

SHORTHAND OBJECT PROPERTIES -- 
____________________________________________________

Objects are great for storing key/value pairs, strings, arrays, etc.  But Objects are a central part of how JS functions behind the scenes 
and how we write our code 

GOALS: 

-add methods to objects 
-use new object shorthand syntax 
-use computed properties 
-understand prototypes 
-explain how the fuck this works 

Shorthand Properties -- 
____________________________________________________

a nice and easy way to create an object literal where you have variables and you want to create a property where the key name is the name 
of your variable and the value is the value in the variable 

const getStats = (arr) => {
    const max = Math.max(...arr);
    const min = Math.min(...arr);
    const sum = arr.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r);
    const avg = sum / arr.length;
    return {
        max: max,
        min: min,
        sum: sum,
        avg: avg
    }
}

const reviews = [4.5,5.0,3.44,2.8,3.5,4.0,3.5];

const stats = getStats(reviews);

this was the old way we had to write it, the short hand is just to pass in the variable that you declare inside the function into the returned object 
to create them: 


const getStats = (arr) => {
    const max = Math.max(...arr);
    const min = Math.min(...arr);
    const sum = arr.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r);
    const avg = sum / arr.length;
    return {
        max,
        min,
        sum,
        avg
    }
}


COMPUTED PROPERTIES -- 
____________________________________________________

computed properties are just an improvement for the object literal syntax where we can add a property with a dynamic key 


const role = 'host';
const person = 'Jools Holland';

const team = {
    role: person 
}

This way is not checking wheter the keys are variables or not and you can set it to anything we know that role is host and person is 'Jools Holland'
The old way to set this up would have been 

const team = {}
team[role] = person; 

team 
//{host: 'Jools Holland'}

with the computed properties we can now use variables as a key name in an object literal property 

const user = 'Jools';

const userRoles = {
    [user]: 'Admin';
}
userRoles // {Jools: 'Admin'}

the variables are evaluated first and it will be set to admin 

Computed Properties are blaytant syntax of creating keys.  you can define a key value pair by passing in a variable and setting as the key 

see app9.js for examples 


ADDING METHODS TO OBJECTS -- 
____________________________________________________    


We can add functions as properties on objects. We call them methods!

const math = {
    multiply: function(x,y){
        return x * y;
    },
    divide: function(x,y){
        return x / y;
    },
    square: function(x){
        return x * x;
    }
};

The simplest explanation of why we do this is just to group functions together, to group functionality into some sort of cohesive unit. 

Shorthand is below this section in app9.js 




INTRO TO THE KEYWORD THIS!!!!!!!! -- 

____________________________________________________
The keyword this can be a major point of confusion and misery and hardship and general suffering in the life of the JS developer
