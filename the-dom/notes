Introduction to the DOM -- 
_______________________________

How JS is going to interact with the dom and HTMl and CSS how to create functionality and behavior that you see on the page 

IMPORTANT NOTE -- HTML AND CSS -- 
_______________________________


SEE APP.js for examples 


TASTE OF THE DOM -- 
_______________________________

What is it? 
- The DOM is a Javascript representation of a webpage 
-It's your js 'window' into the contents of a webpage 
-Its just a bunch of objects that you can interact with via JS 

Stands for Document Object Model 

When the page loads up it is going to turn everything on that page into objects, JS objects

It is the JS rpresentation of content on the page and it consists of a bunch of JS objects 

HTML AND CSS go in and spits out JS Objects representing the HTML and CSS 

HTML AND CSS GOES IN ... 

<body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Water Plants</li>
        <li>Get Some Sleep</li>
    </ul>
</body>


JS OBJECTS COME OUT .... 

DOCUMENT 
    -BODY 
        -h1
        -ul--
            -li
            -li



When you go to a website and grab a button or an input by its id you'll notice that they are just JS Objects the way that we made them in consle

to see the object type in console.dir(variable name or dom element)

from there you see that almost everything has a key 

TO SUM UP the dom is just a bunch of JS objects.  Knowing that, we can find its values within the object itself and maipulate the dom how 
we want 



ANOTHER FUN DOM EXAMPLE -- 
_______________________________

Examples with google.com homepage 

we are using the Snippets section on the dev tools -- sources < snippets < new snippet 

i made app2.js whcih is hooked up to index2.html 

maybe some cool css shit for your project 



THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL -- 
_______________________________
THE DOM :
-Document 
-Object 
-Model 

Lets start with the DOCUMENT -- 
the documnet object is our entry point into the world of the DOM. It contains representaions of all the content on a page plus tons of useful 
methods and properties 

Document is an object that you have in every single browser that you open 

console.dir(document) -- in console will show you the current document object 
document.querySelector 

whenever we want access to the document we type it then dot notation a method or function 


getElementById --
